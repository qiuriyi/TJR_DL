Python codes for paper "Predictive modeling of the total joint replacement surgery risk: a deep learning based approach with claims data": https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6568108/

These are the deep learning models and notebooks I created as a DS intern at Fidelity in summer 2018, under the supervision of Dr. Yugang Jia. By the end of the summer, I was able to submit the results as a conference paper to AMIA Informatics Summit 2019

EHR data representation methods explored: multi-hot encoding, medical feature embedding (using word embedding tool to encode medical features)
DL models explored for EHR-based predictive tasks: 1-d CNN, GRU, GRU with pooling
